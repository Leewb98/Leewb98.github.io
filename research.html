    <h3>Medical Image Analysis</h3>
    Medical image analysis is the process of extracting meaningful information from medical images, often using computational methods. Some of the tasks for medical image analysis are visualization and exploration of 2D images and 3D volumes, segmentation, classification, registration, and 3D reconstruction of image data. The images for this analysis can be obtained from medical imaging modalities such as x-ray (2D and 3D), ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear imaging (PET and SPECT), and microscopy.

    <h3>PET/CT Imaging</h3>
    PET/CT is a new imaging modality that integrates functional (PET) and structural (CT) information into a single scanning session, allowing excellent fusion of the PET and CT images and thus improving lesion localization and interpretation accuracy. Moreover, the CT data can also be used for attenuation correction, ultimately leading to high patient throughput. These combined advantages have rendered PET/CT a preferred imaging modality over dedicated PET. Although PET/CT imaging offers many advantages, this dual-modality imaging also poses some challenges. CT-based attenuation correction can induce artifacts and quantitative errors that can affect the PET emission images. For instance, the use of contrast medium and the presence of metallic implants can be associated with focal radiotracer uptake. Furthermore, the patient’s breathing can introduce mismatches between the CT attenuation map and the PET emission data, and the discrepancy between the CT and PET fields of view can lead to truncation artifacts.

    <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
    Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly  programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.

    <h3>Computer Vision</h3>
    Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs — and take actions or make recommendations based on that information.
